# Access Specifiers

In C++, there are three access specifiers:
- **Public:** members are accessible from outside the class
- **Private:** members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
- **Protected:** members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes.
