A class is a C++ vehicle for translating an abstraction to a user-defined type. It combines data representation and methods for manipulating that data into one neat package.
You can define a class. Generally, a class specification has two parts:
1. A class declaration, which describes the data component in terms of data members, and a public interface in terms of member functions (called as methods)
2. The class method definitions, which describe how certains class member functions are implemented.

In our example, `Rectangle` is a class with `length` and `breadth` as data-members. We have provided some functions such as `area()` and `perimeter()` which are member functions (or methods).
