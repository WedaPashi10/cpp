# Copy assignment operator

We have seen Copy constructors earlier, which is invoked if an object of a class is initialized as a copy of an existing
object of the same class.

A Copy Assignment Operator of a class `Foo` is a non-template, non-static member function with the name `operator=` that takes
exactly one parameter of type `Foo`, `Foo&`, `const Foo&` or `const volatile &Foo`. For a type to be copy-assignable, it
must have a `public` copy assignment operator.

Wait, whats is _Copy-assignable_?
The class `Foo` is copy-assignable if:
 - The type `Foo` satisfied _move-assignable_
 - `f` which is a lvalue expression of `Foo` is a modifiable
 - `fx` which is a lvalue expression of type `Foo` or `const Foo` or an rvalue expression of type `const Foo`.

Coming back to Copy Assignment Operator, a typical syntax:

    className& className :: operator=(className)
    className& className :: operator=(const className&)
    className& className :: operator=(const className&) = default;
    className& className :: operator=(const className&) = delete;

Meaning --
 - Copy assignment operator when copy-and-swap idiom is used
 - Copy assignment operator when copy-and-swap idiom is NOT used
 - FOrcing a copy assignment operator to be generated by compiler using the `default` keyword
 - Avoiding implicit copy assignment

The copy assignment operator is called whenever selected by overload resolution -- when an object appears on the left side of an assignment expression.
