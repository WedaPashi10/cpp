# Virtual functions

This is a very popular amongst people taking C++ interviews. 

A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function. 

__Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of reference (or pointer) used for function call.
__They are mainly used to achieve Runtime polymorphism
__Functions are declared with a virtual keyword in base class.
__The resolving of function call is done at Run-time.

Rules for Virtual Functions

__Virtual functions cannot be static.
__A virtual function can be a friend function of another class.
__Virtual functions should be accessed using pointer or reference of base class type to achieve run time polymorphism.
__The prototype of virtual functions should be the same in the base as well as derived class.
__They are always defined in the base class and overridden in a derived class. It is not mandatory for the derived __class to override (or re-define the virtual function), in that case, the base class version of the function is used.
__A class may have virtual destructor but it cannot have a virtual constructor.
