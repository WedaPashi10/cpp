# Function overloading
Function overloading is a feature of object oriented programming where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters.
Meaning, C++ allows you to have two functions with the same name with a constraints that the arguments should be different. 

It is important to note that functions can not be overloaded if they differ only in the return type. 

Member function declarations with the same name and the name parameter-type-list cannot be overloaded if any of them is a static member function declaration
