Lets get this straight! Function overriding helps levaraging inheritance. Virtual functions help to define interfaces.
And, pure virtual functions are required to achieve polymorphism.

A class that contains pure virtual function is called abstract class.
You can't create an object of an abstract class, you can not instantiate an abstract class. However, you can declare a pointer of the abstract class type.

By the way, if a base class contains only the pure virtual functions, then it also is an Interface.
