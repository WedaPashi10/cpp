# Data hiding by means of Encapsulation

In normal terms Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulates them.

Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction or hiding, as using encapsulation also hides the data.
