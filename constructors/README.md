A constructor is 
    - a member function of a class
    - initializes objects of a class 
    - is invoked when object is created
    - has the same name as the class itself
    - doesn't have a return type
Types of constructors:
    - Default: Doesn't take an argument, compiler provides this implicitly if we don't define one
    - Parameterized: As the name suggests, takes arguments that help to initialize the members of the class
    - Copy: Uses another object of the same class to initialize the class members
