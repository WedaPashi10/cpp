# C++
These are C++ Programs developed during the knowledge-building of C++ programming. I understand that these codes in any form as of today are not suitable/worthy of using in any of the ongoing developments.

A huge segment of the write-ups are taken (at times, word by word) from many of the reference books that I have been
going through such as C++ Prime Plus by Stephen Prata. I have been a huge admirer of his way of writing technical
content and explaning concepts of programming in a manner more relatable to a engineer than a mere student.
